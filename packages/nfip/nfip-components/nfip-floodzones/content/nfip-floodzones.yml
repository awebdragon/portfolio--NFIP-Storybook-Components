    <h5><strong>High Risk Coastal</strong></h5>
    <p>Zones V and VE are high-risk coastal areas with an additional hazard from storm waves. These areas have a 26% chance of flooding over the life of a 30-year mortgage. In communities that participate in the NFIP, flood insurance is mandatory for federally backed mortgages. </p><p><a href='#'>Learn more about Zone V</a></p>"

      <h5><strong>Undetermined Risk</strong></h5>
      <p>Zone D includes areas with possible flood hazards, but the lack of adequate data to determine probability makes them undetermined. Insurance rates are based on the uncertainty of the flood risk. Flood insurance is recommended. </p>

      <h5><strong>Moderate Risk</strong></h5>
      <p>B & X Zones represent areas with a moderate risk of flooding. These areas may have reduced their risk with mitigation efforts such as levees, or experience shallow flooding, with water usually less than 1 foot deep or covering less than 1 square mile. Flood insurance is recommended.</p>

      <h5><strong>High Risk</strong></h5>
      <p>Zones A, AE, AH, AO, AR and A99 are high-risk flood areas, due to proximity to a pond, stream, river or protective barrier under construction. In communities that participate in the NFIP, flood insurance is mandatory if mortgages are federally backed.</p>
